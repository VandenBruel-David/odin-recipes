    <h2>How to Roast a Chicken</h2>
    <p>
      Roasting a whole chicken at home is easier than it seems. You'll find a
      detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe
      below, but let's go over the basics:
    </p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Chicken: This recipe starts with a 3-pound whole chicken. If your bird
        is larger or smaller, you'll need to adjust the recipe.
      </li>
      <li>
        Seasonings: This roasted chicken is simply seasoned with salt, black
        pepper, and onion powder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Butter: Butter (or margarine, if you prefer) locks in moisture and gives
        the seasonings something to adhere to.
      </li>
      <li>
        Celery: Stuff the chicken cavity with celery for subtle vegetal flavor.
        Plus, the celery will release even more moisture as the chicken cooks.
      </li>
    </ul>
